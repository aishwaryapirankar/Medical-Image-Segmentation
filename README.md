# Medical Image Analysis for Tumor Detection and Segmentation

## Overview
This project aims to detect and segment brain tumors in MRI scans using deep learning techniques. The dataset used for this project is the LGG-MRI Segmentation dataset available on Kaggle, which consists of MRI scans with corresponding tumor masks.

## Data Source
The dataset can be found on Kaggle: [LGG-MRI Segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation)

## Objective
The objectives of this project are:
- Perform data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the MRI scans.
- Train a classifier model to detect if a tumor exists in the MRI scans.
- Implement a ResUNet architecture for tumor segmentation to localize and segment the tumors.

## Achievements
- **Data Visualization:** Explored the dataset using various visualization techniques to gain insights into the distribution and characteristics of the MRI scans and tumor masks.
- **Tumor Detection:** Trained a classifier model using ResNet architecture, achieving an accuracy of 98% in detecting the presence of tumors in MRI scans.
- **Tumor Segmentation:** Implemented a ResUNet model for tumor segmentation, enabling precise localization and segmentation of tumors in MRI scans.
- **Improved Disease Detection:** The developed models enhance the disease detection and localization processes, increasing both speed and accuracy for medical imaging modalities such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRI.

## Results
- **Classifier Model Accuracy:** 98.9%
- **Tumor Segmentation Performance:** 

## Future Work
- Explore advanced deep learning techniques for improved tumor detection and segmentation.
- Extend the application to other medical imaging modalities.
- Investigate transfer learning approaches for tasks with limited data availability.
